- 👋 Hi, I’m @garrettdfield
- 👀 I’m interested in beginning my coding "journey".  "Journey" is the term everyone is using these days, right?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.  Right now I am working my way through some free courses with Udemy, Coursera, edx, along with some Youtube videos.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects.  What they are I do not know.  I will though, with the help of this community!  
- 📫 How to reach me.  I can be reached at my email address, garrett.d.field@gmail.com.  I can also be reached via my linkedin profile, https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrettdfield/.  At this point, I assume I can be reached through github as well!
